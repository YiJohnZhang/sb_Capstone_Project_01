    # hm... although pet_search_table is M:1+1:1, effectively a M:1 rel, nvm. I am doing this because there isn't much more info that varies between dataset members. 

# some captured ieas:
# let listers list a "general listing" content area, i.e. general policy; for adoptions, one can set a general adoption fee that will be displayed on all animal pages
# then have the description that state anything to either override the above or re-affirm that the "general listing" overrides the "general listing policy", idk.
